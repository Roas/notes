Setting up auto connection


To make your headset auto connect you need to enable PulseAudio's
switch-on-connect module. Do this by adding the following lines to your the
following to your /etc/pulse/default.pa:


/etc/pulse/default.pa


# automatically switch to newly-connected devices

load-module module-switch-on-connect


Now make bluetoothctl trust your Bluetooth headset by running trust
00:1D:43:6D:03:26 inside the bluetoothctl console to prevent errors similar to:


bluetoothd[487]: Authentication attempt without agent

bluetoothd[487]: Access denied: org.bluez.Error.Rejected


[bluetooth]# trust 00:1D:43:6D:03:26


By default, your Bluetooth adapter will not power on after a reboot. The former
method by using hciconfig hci0 up is deprecated, see the release note. Now you
just need to add the line AutoEnable=true in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf at the
bottom in the [Policy] section:


/etc/bluetooth/main.conf
